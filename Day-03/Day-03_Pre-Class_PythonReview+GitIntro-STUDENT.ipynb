Options for working with text files in the terminal include vi/vim, emacs, nano, etc. If you installed Atom, you can use that!\n",

When you make your commit, git will dump you into a default text editor based on the current config setting in git. Unless you changed the default, there is a good chance that this will be \"vi\" or \"vim\", here is some information on [using vi/vim](https://coderwall.com/p/adv71w/basic-vim-commands-for-getting-started). The main trick is entering \"insert mode\" when the file first opens, writing your message, exiting insert mode, and then saving and exiting the file. **Note**: Make sure to include informative commit messages any time you commit something. If you want to avoid getting put into a text editor, you can use the `-m` flag and include your commit message automatically when you run the commit command on the command line.\n",
