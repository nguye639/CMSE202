    "\n",
    "What is inquiry-based learning? The concept behind inquiry-based learning is that you take control of your learning process and pursue a question or activity that you are personally interested in while still staying within the bounds of the course content. In order to accomplish this, the learning process is left intentionally open-ended and the instructor serves primarily as a facilitator who helps to guide you to the desired learning outcomes rather than someone who's just there to give you the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this style of learning provides tremendous freedom in how you go about reaching the learning goals of the activity, it can also feel a bit unusual and can occasionally lead to feelings of frustration. This frustration can stem from feeling like you don't know where you're headed in the activity, but it can also be an indicator that you're pushing the current bounds of your knowledge and you're about to make a breakthrough in your understanding of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inquiry-based learning is more closely aligned with the nature of most research environments than many of the more traditional ways of learning. When doing research, you rarely know what the right answer is and it's up to you determine what question you want to answer and how you want to go about answering it. Like research, there is often no one path to the \"right answer\" when carrying out an inquiry-based invesigation. This requires that you stay engaged in the learning process and ask yourself if the work you're doing is serving to answer the question you set out to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular inquiry-based investigation, we'll be working on creating numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations."
