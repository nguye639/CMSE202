    "The signals from different cellphone towers that are close together can interfere.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to avoid this overlap cell phone companies use different frequency ranges in the Electromagnetic spectrum.  Two towers that are close together but have differences in frequencies (shown as colors, red/green/black in the following figure) do not cause nearly as much interference. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, cellphone towers are never distributed in such an even pattern.   Consider the following map which shows the location of cell towers around Michigan State.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: right;\">From: http://www.antennasearch.com/</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that cellphone companies have to pay for each frequency range they use.  So they would like minimize the number of frequencies that they need to purchase while also minimizing the interference between the cell towers. \n",

    "In this assignment you are going to work as a group to solve this problem using graph coloring."
