Step 3 might be a bit challenging because you have to figure out the right syntax to get the NetworkX module to work. Feel free to discuss issues you run into with others on Slack. It's OK if you can't get Part 3 figured out before class as long as you've tried it. Make sure you complete the final part of the assignment where you're asked to come up with an outline for how you would solve the cell phone tower problem."
