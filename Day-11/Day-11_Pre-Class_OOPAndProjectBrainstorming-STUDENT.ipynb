    "When simulating environment researchers often break the environment into discrete nodes based on location.  Each node is connected to it's neighbors and form a network often called a **mesh** (see image below).   At each simulated time step the dynamics of the environment are calculated independently at each node. Then between each time step the properties of the environment (such as energy, mass or forces) are transfered across the borders between nodes.   \n",
