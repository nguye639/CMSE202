Extracting features from our data can sometimes be one of the trickier parts of the process and also one of the most important ones. We have to think carefully about exactly what the \"right\" features are for training our machine learning algorithm and, when possible, it is advantageous to find ways to reduce the total number of features we are trying to model. Once we define our features, we can build our model."
