    "\n",
    "In the assignment repository for Day 21, along with this notebook, you should see a file called '51_Pegasi_RadVel.dat'. This file contains radial velocity data (which is the line-of-sight velocity) for a star called \"51 Pegasi\", a star located in the Pegasus constellation. This radial velocity data indicates that the star is \"wobbling\" towards and away from us as we look at it. This stellar wobble is actually a sign that there is another relatively massive object orbiting the star and gravititational pulling it around (see the image above). In fact, this star happens to be home to the first extrasolar planet ever observed around a main-sequence star (a star that currently fusing hydrogen into helium in it's core much like our Sun). This planet was originally given the very original name of \"[51 Pegasi b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi_b)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers were able to observe that there is a planet orbiting 51 Pegasi through a method referred to as [Doppler Spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy). Basically, if you can measure the radial velocity \"wobbles\" of the star and you understand a bit about orbital mechanics, you can fit a model to the data and determine the properties of the object that is causing the wobbles. You're going to do this in-class today. And you're going to do it using the MCMC method we learned in the last class period!\n",
    "\n",
    "(Side note: it turns out that one of the previous CMSE 202 instructors has a bit of experience with [modeling the orbits of stars and using MCMC methods to estimate parameters](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/588545/meta). Clearly this topic was chosen by coincidence)\n",

    "\n",
    ">The general idea behind MCMC fitting of our data is that we will start from a guess at our model parameters and \"walk\" in random directions in parameter space in a way that **on average gets us closer to the best fit to the data.**  We keep track of the points that we've sampled over time (we call this the \"trace\" of the data), and use those to create a distribution.  The distribution shows us how likely each set of model parameters is to fit the data.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    f(x) = W x^2 + I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "by intelligently searching for optimal $W$ and $I$ (_width_ and _intercept_ of the parabola) values. Specifically, Metropolis-Hastings fitting consists of these steps:\n",
    "1. Start with an initial guess of the model parameters, $(W_0, I_0)$.\n",
    "2. Take a (potential) \"step\" from $(W_0, I_0)$ in a random direction to produce $(W_1, I_1)$\n",
    "3. Calculate the the [\"reduced chi-squared\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_chi-squared_statistic) values (as done in the pre-class), $\\chi_0^2$ and $\\chi_1^2$, for the parabolas defined by $(W_0, I_0)$ and $(W_1, I_1)$.\n",
    "4. Calculate an acceptance probability, $P = e^{-\\chi_1^2}/e^{-\\chi_0^2}$, as the ratio of two *likelihood functions* (the exponentials).\n",
    "5. Uniformly generate a random number $r \\in [0, 1)$. If $r < P$, \"accept\" $(W_1, I_1)$ as the next initial guess. Otherwise, discard $(W_1, I_1)$ and generate a new potential step from $(W_0, I_0)$.\n",
    "6. Repeat this process until you've generated as many points as you care to, keeping in mind that you need to have _enough_ points for the walker to find the right values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this problem, using the same stepsize for every parameter probably doesn't make sense since the values themselves differ substantially. Instead, **use a step size that is no larger than 10% of the current parameter value**.\n",
