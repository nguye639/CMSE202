    "* Understand the difference between absolute and relative paths.\n",
    "* Modify existing code to add additional functionality\n",
    "* Explain a basic level of chaos theory to your friends at parties\n",

    "\n",
    "There are **25 points** possible on this assignment. Point values for each part are included in the section headers.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. In the repository, create a new directory called \"`homework-02`\".\n",
    "2. Move this notebook into that new directory within your cloned repository.\n",
    "3. Add the notebook file to your git repository with the appropriate git command.\n",

    "If everything went as intended, the new folder and the notebook file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-s19-turnin`\" repository you created for Homework 1.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit.\n"

Let assume the code you are running is in a directory called “code” and calls a file in a directory called “code_subfolder”.  If you write your code such that it calls the file in “code_subfolder”  using an absolute path then the code probably won’t run on any computer except yours.  This is because when your code uses the path\n",

This is useful for two reasons: (1) we don’t have to type out a long path to the correct folder and (2) this gives our code “portability”.  That is, the code can be run on anyone’s computer.  If you send us code that relies on an absolute path, then we cannot run the code and thus cannot assess your work.\n",

If your homework submission does not create the needed directories within the notebook,  your code will produce an error. This can be fixed by recalling how to use the “!” operator along with the \"mkdir\" command.\n",
