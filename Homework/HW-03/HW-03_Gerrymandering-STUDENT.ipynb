The data contained in this file has already been prepared so that it can be easily converted to a pandas dataframe. The focus of this assignment is to practice visualizing and modeling a set of data assuming that it has already been organized in a useful way. In practice, it is rare that you will find such a well prepared dataset. The first step in any data science project almost always involves collecting data and organizing it.

    "### Some Jargon\n",
    "What you should find in the dataframe you created in Part 1.0 is the population of each of Michigan's 83 counties, as well as the number of democratic/republican votes cast in that county during the 2016 presidential election. In the final column is a 'DistrictCode' which approximates the congressional district each county sits in. We will explore the 'DistrictCode' further during a later section. For now, we will try to visualize the outcome of the election using the data we have together with some of the built in pandas plotting methods. One simple way to visualize this data is to plot the difference between the democratic votes and the republican votes in each county using a scatter plot or bar graph. Hopefully you already know how to create a scatter plot or bar graph using matplotlib. However, something you may not be so familiar with are the matplotlib functions specifically designed to work with the dataframes! A python **_class_** is a single structure which encompases both an object and a special set of functions which can act on that object. We call these special functions **_class methods_** and we can access them using the 'dot' notation like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "'my_class.method()'\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that method calls require parenthesis just like standard function calls. The technique of storing objects together with the methods that act on those objects into classes is the central concept of **_Object Oriented Programming_**. In fact, since we have the capability to construct classes in python, we call it an **_Object Oriented Programming Language_**. We will learn much more about classes and methods during the course of this semester. In this section, we will simply explore some useful methods from a python class you are already familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1.1:\n",
    "Let's see what a python class looks like in action. In the cell below is a simple example of a pandas dataframe which is one example of a class. Inside of the dataframe class there is a method called `plot.scatter` which is built on top of matplotlib's `plt.scatter` function. One convienience of using the `plot.scatter` method is that we can usually just set parameters by passing in the name of a column headings in our dataframe."

Put simply, GeoPandas is a tool which makes it easier to create maps from datasets collected within highly accurate geographic boundaries such as county lines.

However, this does come at some cost. Our model requires us to assign each node (county) to a single district. Currently, three of Michigan's congressional districts essentially span two counties: Wayne and Oakland. This means that one of the congressional districts which lies predominantly between the two counties is left out of our model. For most other counties this was not a problem since the entire county votes in a single congressional district.

For example, Washtenaw county was assigned to the congressional district which represents the city of Ann Arbor.\n",

Intuitively, the centroid can be thought of as the center of the polygon formed by the county lines. Luckily for us, GeoSeries objects always keep track of the centroid of each polygon. All we have to do is call the centroid method on the geometry column of our GeoDataFrame. In a regular pandas dataframe, a single column is its own distinct type of object called a pandas Series. Similarly, the geometry column is itself a kind of geopandas object called a GeoSeries.
