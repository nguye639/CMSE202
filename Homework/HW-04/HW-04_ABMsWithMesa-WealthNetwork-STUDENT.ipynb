    "In this assignment, you'll be exploring how you can use the Python package \"Mesa\" to run agent-based models. Remember, one of the focuses of this class is learning how to use pre-existing software packages to solve problems. In this assignment you'll need to install Mesa, read the documention, and work through the Mesa tutorial individually. After that, you'll work off of a pre-existing example and make modifications to it to explore how money can move through a network of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary motivations for this assignment, beyond thinking about agent-based models, is to get you more practice with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Mesa is built upon a framework of classes and functions and you'll be finding ways to work with the functionality of those classes to expand beyond the basic model.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WHO USE JUPYTERHUB**: If you've been using JupyterHub ([jupyterhub.egr.msu.edu](http://jupyterhub.egr.msu.edu)) for your assignments up to this point, **READ THIS!!!**. Because of the way that the Mesa package does the simulation visualization, it is not possible to run the visualization on JupyterHub. This means that starting with Step 3 of Part 1 of the assignment, you will need to be working with a Python installation that is installed *locally*. Being able to run software locally on your computer is an important part of being a computational professional! If you don't have a functioning Python installation on your computer, you should try to remedy this **as soon as possible**. See you instructor, TA, or LA **right away** if you need help with this. If for some reason installing Python locally on your own computer is not viable, it is also possible to use any of the DECS computers in the Engineering Building, but getting everything running correctly might require a bit of effort, so running everything on your own computer is the preferable option. If you decide to use one of the DECS computers, contact your instructor **right away** for details about how to best make this work.  \n",
